SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Find your device's public IP address.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module connects to Internet services to find your device's public IPv4
    and/or IPv6 addresses.

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> Get-WANIPAddress

    Type  IP Address
    ----  ----------
    IPv4  192.0.2.1
    IPv6  2001:db8::1

SERVICES AND TERMS OF USE
    By default, this cmdlet defaults to using the web site ip6.me to conduct its
    testing.  By using this cmdlet, you inherently consent to their terms of use
    and privacy policy.  If you do not consent, supply the -Service parameter to
    select one of the following supported services:
     - ip6.me (default)
     - MyIP

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    If your computer has multiple network interfaces with an Internet connection
    that's working, note that this cmdlet will only test whichever one your OS's
    network stack considers to be the primary.  Refer to your operating system's
    documentation.

    This cmdlet does not implement "Happy Eyeballs" and will test IPv4 and IPv6,
    regardless of whether or not it is configured or working properly.   This is
    by design, unless you specify the -IPv4Only or -IPv6Only parameters.
